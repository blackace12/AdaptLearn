    <h1>Solitary Learner: </h1>

    <p>&nbsp;If you have a solitary style, you are more private, introspective and independent. You can concentrate well, focusing
      your thoughts and feelings on your current topic. You are aware of your own thinking, and you may analyze the different
      ways you think and feel.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;You spend time on self-analysis, and often reflect on past events and the way you approached them. You take time
      to ponder and assess your own accomplishments or challenges. You may keep a journal, diary or personal log to record
      your personal thoughts and events.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;You like to spend time alone. You may have a personal hobby. You prefer traveling or holidaying in remote or places,
      away from crowds.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;You prefer to work on problems by retreating to somewhere quiet and working through possible solutions. You may
      sometimes spend too much time trying to solve a problem that you could more easily solve by talking to someone.</p>
    <h5>Common pursuits and phrases</h5>
    <p>
      Those that have a strong solitary style include authors, researchers, park rangers and security guards. Peak performers in
      any field often have a good solitary style behind other more dominant styles.
    </p>
    <br> Here are some other phrases you may also use:

    <ul class="a">
      <li>I'd like some time to think it over.</li>
      <li>This is what I think or feel about that.</li>
      <li>I'd like to get away from everyone for a while.</li>
      <li>I'll get back to you on that.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h5>Learning and techniques</h5>
    <p>You prefer to learn alone using self-study. When you spend time with an instructor or a teacher, you often only clarify
      information you haven't be able to clarify yourself. You may dislike learning in groups.</p>
    <ul class="a">
      <li>Spend more time on the 'Target' step of the Memletic Approach. Set your goals, objectives and plans. Define ultra-clear
        visualizations or scripts of what life is like once you've achieved your goals. Understand your reasons for undertaking
        each objective, and ensure that you are happy with your learning goals.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Create a personal interest in your topics. An example for pilots might be to learn more about other aviators, both
        current and past. Why do others find aviation interesting? What is in it for them? What keeps them motivated? Why
        do they work in the field? You may also want to look at the people behind your books or material. What was their
        motivation to create it? Why do you think they organized the material in the way they did? Can you ask them?</li>
      <br>
      <li>Keep a log or journal. You may want to keep one separate from your normal journal or training log. Include extra information
        about your thoughts and feelings. Outline your challenges, ideas on how to overcome them, and what worked. Write
        down what works well and doesn't work well for you. While you are studying, be aware of thoughts or concerns that
        arise. Write them down and come back to them. Discuss with others later if needed. Bear in mind it may be more efficient
        to put something that confuses you aside, and ask others later. This is often better than spending too much time
        trying to work it out yourself.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Modeling is a powerful technique for you. Don't just model behaviors and appearance. Try to get 'inside their heads'
        and model the thought patterns and feelings you believe they have in various circumstances. You can gain ideas by
        talking to people or reading biographies. Remember you don't have to find a single perfect model. Create a model
        that combines several people.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>When changing behaviors and habits, you need to have a strong desire to make the changes you want. Explore the benefits
        of making a change, and visualize scenarios in which you've already made the change. If you don't believe strongly
        in the benefits, you may find it difficult to change the behavior.</li>
    </ul>
