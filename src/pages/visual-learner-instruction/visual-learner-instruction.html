    <h1>Visual Learner: </h1>

    <p>&nbsp;Prefers using images, pictures, colors, and maps to organize information and communicate with others. You can easily
      visualize objects, plans and outcomes in your mind's eye. You also have a good spatial sense, which gives you a good
      sense of direction. You can easily find your way around using maps, and you rarely get lost. When you walk out of an
      elevator, you instinctively know which way to turn.</p>

       <br>
    <h5>Common pursuits and phrases</h5>
    <p>
      &nbsp;Some pursuits that make the most use of the visual style are visual art, architecture, photography, video or film, design,
      planning (especially strategic), and navigation.
    </p>
    <br> You may tend to use phrases like these:

    <ul class="a">
      <li>Let's look at it differently.</li>
      <li>See how this works for you.</li>
      <li>I can't quite picture it.</li>
      <li>Let's draw a diagram or map.</li>
      <li>I'd like to get a different perspective.</li>
      <li>I never forget a face.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h5>Learning and techniques</h5>
    <p>
      If you are a visual learner, use images, pictures, color and other visual media to help you learn. Incorporate much imagery
      into your visualizations.
    </p>

    <ul class="a">
      <li>Use color, layout, and spatial organization in your associations, and use many 'visual words' in your assertions. Examples
        include see, picture, perspective, visual, and map.</li>
        <br>
      <li>Use mind maps. Use color and pictures in place of text, wherever possible. If you don't use the computer, make sure
        you have at least four different color pens.</li>
        <br>
      <li>Systems diagrams can help you visualize the links between parts of a system, for example major engine parts or the
        principle of sailing in equilibrium. Replace words with pictures, and use color to highlight major and minor links.</li>
        <br>
      <li>The visual journey or story technique helps you memorize content that isn't easy to 'see.' The visual story approach
        for memorizing procedures is a good example of this.</li>
        <br>
      <li>Peg words and events come easily to you, however you need to spend some time learning at least the first ten peg words.
        Afterwards, your ability to visualize helps you peg content quickly.</li>
        <br>
      <li>The swish technique for changing behaviors also works well for you, as it relies on visualization.</li>
    </ul>
