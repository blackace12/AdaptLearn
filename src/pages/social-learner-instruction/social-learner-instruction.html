    <h1>Social Learner: </h1>

    <p>&nbsp;If you have a strong social style, you communicate well with people, both verbally and non-verbally. People listen
      to you or come to you for advice, and you are sensitive to their motivations, feelings or moods. You listen well and
      understand other's views. You may enjoy mentoring or counseling others.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;You typically prefer learning in groups or classes, or you like to spend much one-on-one time with a teacher or
      an instructor. You heighten your learning by bouncing your thoughts off other people and listening to how they respond.
      You prefer to work through issues, ideas and problems with a group. You thoroughly enjoy working with a 'clicking'
      or synergistic group of people.</p>

    <h5>Common pursuits and phrases</h5>
    <p>
      Some examples of pursuits that people with a strong social style may follow include counseling, teaching, training and coaching,
      sales, politics, human resources, and others.
    </p>
    <br> As with people with the logical style, you are more likely to use phrases that reflect your dominant style out of
    physical, aural and visual styles. Here are some other phrases you may also use:

    <ul class="a">
      <li>Let's work together on this.</li>
      <li>We can work it out.</li>
      <li>Tell me what you are thinking.</li>
      <li>Help me understand this.</li>
      <li>Let's pull some people together to discuss.</li>
      <li>Let's explore our options.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h5>Learning and techniques</h5>
    <ul class="a">
      <li>If you are a social learner, aim to work with others as much as possible. Try to study with a class. If this is not
        available then consider forming your own study group with others at a similar level. They don't have to be from the
        same school or class. If you like, introduce them to some of the techniques from this book. It may be easier for
        you to try some of the Memletic Techniques in a social setting, and work with the feedback from others.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Role-playing is a technique that works well with others, whether its one on one or with a group of people. For example,
        in aviation training, role-play the aerodrome area. Have people walking around in 'circuits' making the right radio
        calls with the tower co-ordinating everyone. Another example might be to role-play with one person being the instructor
        and the other being the student.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Work on some of your associations and visualizations with other people. Make sure they understand the principles of
        what you are doing though, otherwise you may get some interesting responses! Others often have different perspectives
        and creative styles, and so the group may come up with more varied and imaginative associations compared to the ones
        you might create yourself.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Mind maps and systems diagrams are great to work on in class. Have one person be the appointed drawer, while the rest
        of the class works through material and suggests ideas. The group may have varied views on how to represent some
        ideas, however this is a positive part of learning in groups. If you can't agree on something, just take a copy of
        what the group has worked on and add your own thoughts. Often there is no right answer for everyone, so agree to
        disagree!</li>
      <br>
      <li>Working in groups to practice behaviors or procedures help you understand how to deal with variations. Seeing the mistakes
        or errors that others make can help you avoid them later. As well, the errors you make are helpful to others! Whether
        it's via role-playing, a simulator or other technique doesn't matter too much. Be imaginative. Two chairs in the
        middle of a classroom to simulate an aircraft cockpit can be just as good as computer simulation and the real activity.</li>
    </ul>
